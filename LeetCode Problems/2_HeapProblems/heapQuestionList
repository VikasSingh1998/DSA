Problem Patterns where HEAP is used
Based on my understanding, different questions where HEAP is common data structure to use can be categorized in following 4 categories:
------------------------------------------
Top K Pattern
Merge K Sorted Pattern
Two Heaps Pattern
Minimum Number Pattern

All questions under one patterns has some similarities in terms of using HEAP as a data structure. 
Completing these questions would gurantee you mastery on the HEAP data structure. 
Below list includes some of the most common questions asked in most of the companies.
